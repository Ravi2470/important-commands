a) One Ubuntu instance for Puppet Master - this instance should have 4 GB RAM, in AWS instance type should be at least t2.medium. Master ubuntu EC2 should have a security group to ensure that below ports are open in security firewall 

        * TCP 8140 - Agents will talk to the master on this port(puppet enterprise) 

  * TCP 22 - To login to the server/instance using SSH 

b) one Ubuntu instance as node which will have agent installed - This can be micro instance. 

 

1 Steps for Puppet Master: 

Modify Puppet Master Hosts file to add hostname of Puppet Master 

sudo vi /etc/hosts 

 

 

(Add puppet master privtae ip address and  write puppet next to it) 

 

Download Puppet Master installation packages 

curl -O https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet6-release-bionic.deb 

sudo dpkg -i puppet6-release-bionic.deb  

sudo apt-get update 

 

Install Puppet Master 

sudo apt-get install puppetserver -y 

sudo ufw allow 8140 

sudo systemctl enable puppetserver.service 

 

sudo systemctl start puppetserver.service    

sudo systemctl status puppetserver.service 

apt policy puppetserver 

 

2 - Steps for Puppet Agent 

Step 2.1 First edit the hosts file on the puppet agent by modifying /etc/hosts 

sudo vi /etc/hosts 

# Please add Puppet Master server Private IP address and space and enter puppet 

puppet_master_private-_ip_address   puppet 

 

(please do not use public DNS name, use only private IP address)   

 

 

 

 

 

Step 2.2 — Installing Puppet Agent on server node that Puppet master will manage 

 

curl -O https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet6-release-bionic.deb 

sudo dpkg -i puppet6-release-bionic.deb 

sudo apt-get update 

sudo apt-get install puppet-agent -y 

sudo systemctl enable puppet 

sudo systemctl restart puppet 

sudo systemctl status puppet 

 

Now press q to come out of window. 

 

 

Step 3 - Signing certificates on Puppet Master 

The first time you run the Puppet agent, it generates an SSL certificate and sends a signing request to the Puppet master. After the Puppet master signs the agent's certificate, it will be able to communicate  with and control the agent node. 

First list the unsigned certificates on puppet master EC2 instance 

sudo /opt/puppetlabs/server/bin/puppetserver ca list 

 

The above command will list agent ip address. 

  "your_puppet_Agent_Ec2_private_dns_name"  (SHA256) 46:19:79:3F:70:19:0A:FB:DA:3D:C8:74:47:EF:C8:B0:05:8A:06:50:2B:40:B3:B9:26:35:F6:96:17:85:5E:7C  

Now sign the Puppet agent IP address. 

sudo /opt/puppetlabs/server/bin/puppetserver ca sign --certname AgentEc2_private_dnsname 

 

Step 4 - Verifying installation by creating Manifests in Puppet Master 

The puppet manifest file is the actual file which contains the configuration details for the agents. This file is centrally stored at Puppet Master 

 

sudo nano /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp 

 

#copy the below yellow lines in the above file 

      file {'/tmp/puppet_test.txt':                        # resource type file and filename 
    ensure  => present,                             # make sure it exists 
    mode    => '0644',                              # file permissions 
  content => "Hello from Puppet master to agent on ${ipaddress_eth0}!\n",  # Print the eth0 IP fact 
    } 

 

Press Ctrl O for saving and then enter 

Press Ctrl X for exit after saving. 

 

Step 5 - Apply Manifests in Puppet Agent 

apply the changes in puppet agent by executing below command: 

 

sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent –test 

 

You should see a file being modified in /tmp/puppet_works.txt in agent(node). 

You can confirm by typing this command on puppet node  

 

sudo cat /tmp/puppet_test.txt 

Hello from Puppet master to agent on IP_address!! 

That's it! you have set up Puppet Master and configured agent on the target node successfully!
